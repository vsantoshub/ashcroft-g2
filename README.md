<b> Ashcroft G2 user interface </b>
<br />
This project was developed inside the Medicine Department of Federal Univesity of Santa Catarina. <br />
The project's purpose is to provide real-time sampling from the Ashcroft G2 pressure transducer, it's used in a medical exam to evaluate hand pressure force. <br />
The prototype is currently in a experimental step, but showing good results.
<br />
Some technologies used are listed below. <br />
<br />
Hardware: <br />
+ Arduino UNO <br />

User-Interface: <br />
+ C# interface developed with Windows Forms framework <br />
+ Serial communication with the hardware  <br />
<br /><br />

<b>User Interface </b>
<br />
The project can be built normally using Microsoft Visual Studio. No external dependencies needed.
<br />
The software saves the user data and generated the exam results in a simple text file format.
<br /><br />
<b>Next Steps </b>
<br />
Testing new mathematical approaches in the real-time pressure graph, such as integral value over the entire graph or the pressure rate of change. These kind of analysis could leave to new useful medical information about the exam. <br />
